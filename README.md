# QR Code Component

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge that involves creating a QR code component. The challenge is to build out the component to the designs provided by Frontend Mentor.

## Challenge Description

Your task is to build out the QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools or frameworks you like, but vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML are recommended.

The designs are available in the `/design` folder and are available in Sketch, Figma, and Adobe XD formats. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the colors and fonts used in the designs.

Your solution should be responsive, and it should work in all modern browsers.
